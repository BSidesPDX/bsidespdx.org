Although we have no in-person event planned for 2021, there are always ways to get involved with BSides PDX at other times of the year. If you have not signed up for our volunteer communication, head over to [this page](../events/2020/volunteer.html).

### Expectations
Volunteers (like participants) are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.html). 

### Roles and Opportunities


* Public attendees are encouraged to attend any/all BSides PDX board meetings. Minutes and information about when/where we meet virtually are shared through the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bsidespdx">BSides PDX Google Group</a>.

* Additionally, please reach out by DMing us on <a href="https://twitter.com/bsidespdx">Twitter</a> and/or by emailing sponsorship@bsidespdx.org if you have any interest in learning or participating in volunteering for the off-season sponsorship volunteer opportunities. 

* While we do not have a social media coordinator at this time, you can reach out to us via DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/bsidespdx">Twitter</a> or by emailing lacey@bsidespdx.org if you have any interest in creative and/or social volunteer opportunities.

* Are you talented with web stuff like managing our static webpages (BSides PDX and HACKBOAT) or Discord? We are always looking for more support to make our sites and Discord better. Please reach out via <a href="https://twitter.com/bsidespdx">Twitter</a>.
