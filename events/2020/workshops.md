## Deploying your own cybersecurity training infrastructure with EDURange
### Jens Mache
Are you interested in hosting your own competitions/ CTFs/ training exercises?  EDURange is an open source project that is both a collection of interactive, collaborative cyber-security exercises and a framework for creating these exercises.  It is designed to provide an active learning environment focusing on analysis skills.

Recently, EDURange has been rebuilt to allow for users to host the application on their own hardware, or to be run on a central cloud server. This means that if you have any machine, whether it’s a server connected to corporate or academic infrastructure, or your own personal computer, you can spin up any of our exercises to play on-demand. These exercises take the form of one or more docker containers that each simulate a complete UNIX environment, and range in difficulty from a basic introduction to using the command line to more advanced network reconnaissance and Metasploit. We’ve also built our exercises with the capability for customization in mind, so if you have your own tools or materials you’d like to include in an exercise, or even create your own, EDURange could be the perfect solution for you.

In this workshop, we will demonstrate the initial setup process of the EDURange platform and assist you with getting it set up on your machine. The installation process is very simple, as we are hoping to be able to provide a pre-configured virtual machine. If you have access to a cloud instance provided by AWS or Azure, that would be a hosting option – but it is also perfectly viable to run it on a spare device from your home network. By the end of this workshop, you will have our full infrastructure deployment system configured on your machine, with the ability for others to sign up or be assigned accounts, and be able to easily launch numerous virtual environments to play our full catalog of exercises. See some of the exercises at [https://edurange.org/scenarios.html](https://edurange.org/scenarios.html)

### Prerequisites
Students should come prepared with:
- A native Ubuntu or Debian machine, or any AWS/Google/Other type of cloud instance or a virtual machine. See the [documentation](https://github.com/edurange/edurange-flask-docs/blob/master/vm_setup.md)

- Alternatively, students can use the hosted demo version, so that anyone with an ssh client can at least try it out and play some of the scenarios.

## Creating a AWS Pentest Playground
### Jon Helmus
This workshop will walk all attendees through a process of setting up a safe pentesting environment that attendees can practice ethical hacking on both AWS services such as S3, Lambda, and EC2 - as well as learning traditional hacking methodologies. 

Aside from ethical hacking, attendees can also expect to learn more about AWS and how to maneuver within the AWS console and the AWSCLI.

### Prerequisites
Students should come prepared with:
- Kali Linux virtual machine (VirtualBox Preferred)
- AWS Account

*Jon Helmus is a Security engineer and educator who has been working in engineering, security, and information technology for 10 years. Specializations in Penetration Testing, Threat and Adversarial Assessments, Vulnerability Management, Cloud Technology (AWS), and experience as a Technical Educator and University Level Professor.*

## Hiding In The Clouds: How Attackers Can Use Malicious Applications for Sustained Persistence and  How To Find It
### Mark Morowczynski and Bailey Bercik
Applications are modernizing. With that, the way permissions for these applications are granted are also changing. These new changes can allow an attacker to have sustained persistence in plain sight if we don’t understand how these work and where to look.  What’s the difference if an application has permissions or an application has delegated permissions? Why did that admin account consent to that application, should I be worried? Is that application overprivileged? I have thousands of apps, how do I account for this? In this session we will look to demystify and bring clarity to these questions. You’ll understand these new application models and how they can be abused for sustained persistence, how these permissions work and what overprivileged looks like and finally, how to find them in your environment.

### Prerequisites
Students should optionally come prepared with:
- An Azure AD tenant to be able follow along.
