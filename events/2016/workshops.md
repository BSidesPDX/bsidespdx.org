    Elk All The Things: Security Analytics for the Masses (1pm-3pm)

    Security analytics can be a difficult and expensive, but it doesn't have to be. Using the open-source ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kiban) is a cost effective way to gain similar functionality found in more expensive commercial tools. The difficult part of the ELK stack mainly lies in complex normalization rules.

    This workshop will teach students the basics of normalizing machine data with Logstash. Additionally, students will learn how to create useful and powerful dashboards within Kibana to expose the most critical data. 

    Requirements

    Attendees will need a laptop capable of powering a virtual machine (VMDK) with 4GB of memory and 20GB of storage space.

    Travis Smith is a Senior Security Research Engineer at Tripwire. He has over 10 years of experience in security, holds an MBA with a concentration in information security, and multiple certifications including CISSP and GPEN. Travis specializes in integrating various technologies and processes, with a passion for digital forensics and security analytics.

    Exploring the IoT For Fun (3pm-5pm)

    In this workshop I will walk through how to get an IoT starter kit from Amazon up and connected to AWS IoT. I will begin with an overview of the AWS IoT architecture and the microcontroller board that is typical in IoT devices. Then I will help participants get the cross-compiler tools installed on their laptop, connect to a IoT board and upload new code to their board. Then we will walk through building the AWS demo and connecting each device to an AWS account and interacting with the board using the AWS IoT dashboard. Finally, I will talk about the threat model for these IoT architecture and how to take what we learned here to analyze the security of real IoT devices.

    Requirements

    This 2 hour workshop will require a Linux or Mac laptop with an available USB port. I will try to supply installers for the necessary software, but it is best if you come with the following software pre-installed from your preferred repository: 

        openOCD: apt-get install openocd OR brew install openocd

        gcc-arm-none-eabi version: 4.9-2015q3-20150921 – linux, macosx 

        minicom or other serial terminal: apt-get install minicom OR brew install minicom

    A familiarity with the C language will help in understanding the code used on the boards.

    Bob Loihl. I am a Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience developing business applications, leading teams and spreading the security word. I have a strong interest in delivering applications that are secure by design in an agile world. In order to do that better I am learning to break them using network and web app penetration testing tools. I am currently employed by Tripwire focused on maturing our Secure Software Development Lifecycle practices. In my spare time, I play with IoT devices, guitars and my kids.
