## Why We Research 
### There is this picture of a security researcher in many people's minds. Some dark clad figure dwells in a basement, surrounded by electronics, and then suddenly a few weeks later an ATM spits money at them. Wowz, lets go write exploits y'all. But is this how it works? Why do people go down these rabbit holes, how does big research come to life, and what if you're not in a basement but back in some office, oh the horrors, and somebody says 'time to production'? We'll explore the question why security research matters, where the ideas come from and what motivates a proof of concept, and the big question: What comes after? Finding the bug is nice, but have you ever tried to patch 900 machines on a Friday night? Ever wondered how mitigations make it into a compiler, or how a machine learning model rolls to production? We'll look at why research matters, and explore what makes it significant.

## <b>What the Function: A Deep Dive into Azure Function App Security</b>
### Karl Fosaaen ([@kfosaaen](https://x.com/kfosaaen))
As organizations have evolved from the "Lift and Shift" cloud migration strategy to building "Cloud Native" applications, there has been a significant increase in the usage of Platform as a Service (PaaS) services in the cloud. The Azure Function App service is a commonly used resource in this space, as it provides easy to deploy application hosting. While the serverless service offers a wide variety of convenient features, it also comes with its own security challenges.

As a VP of Research, Karl is part of a team developing new services and product offerings at NetSPI. Karl previously oversaw the Cloud Penetration Testing service lines at NetSPI and is one of the founding members of NetSPI's Portland, OR team. Karl has a Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Minnesota and has been in the security consulting industry for over 15 years. Karl spends most of his research time focusing on Azure security and contributing to the NetSPI blog.

## <b>Leave your corporate masters and come work for government!</b>
### Jeff 
Are you a cybersecurity pro weary from the endless grind of the private sector? Do you feel like you've been fighting the same battles day in and day out? It might be time for a change of scenery-one with different perks and a lot less burnout. Sure the pay is worse, but at least we're union and may have pensions!

In this talk, we'll explore why state and local governments are a new frontier for cybersecurity professionals. With a wave of retirements opening up key positions, there's never been a better time to make the switch. Plus, the benefits are pretty cool: think solid job security, better work-life balance and the satisfaction of protecting your community from cyber threats. Also you can appear to be a cyber wizard! Local governments need our help now more than ever!

Join us for a humorous and informative dive into working in state and local government cybersecurity. We'll discuss why trading in your corporate badge for a government one might just be the best career move you'll ever make. Let's face it- defending a city's digital infrastructure sounds way more badass than boosting your firm's quarterly profits by 5% this quarter.

## <b>Can LLMs Take Our Jobs? AI-Assisted Detection Research</b>
### Darin Smith (No additional social info)
The detection research process consists of performing behavior that will trigger existing detection rules, performing behavior that accomplishes the same adversary objective without triggering the rule (rule bypasses), and updating the rule to catch this behavior. This existing process requires significant security expertise and is quite time consuming even for those with the requisite knowledge. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to assist with performing exactly this type of complex, time consuming task.

## <b>Securing the Future: Tackling Q-day and Leap-day challenges with CodeQL</b>
### Tong Fu, Asha Maran
Ensuring the security and reliability of code is more important than ever. Quantum computing looms as a game-changing threat that could render existing cryptographic standards obsolete, while seemingly minor issues like leap year bugs can bring entire systems to a halt. Real-world vulnerabilities like these often require combining nuanced and disparate information to identify sources and sinks of vulnerable data flow in the source code, as well as understanding the conditions and guards along the way that may need to be hit or avoided. Static code analyses offer a solution to identify weaknesses in software continuously throughout its life cycle, both pre- and post-deployment. CodeQL stands out in the industry as a state-of-the-art enterprise static analysis solution, capable of analyzing large-scale, commercial software products. With CodeQL, security engineers have the flexibility to combine data from various sources, such as type information, control flow and inter-procedural dataflow, to detect underlying vulnerabilities. This presentation will focus on how static analysis, specifically CodeQL, can proactively identify vulnerabilities and safeguard code from these imminent risks before they become serious problems. We will focus on two current real-world examples: (1) preparing software systems for Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and (2) assessing systems for the presence of leap year vulnerabilities to ensure the world keeps running smoothly on that extra day every four years.

Tong Fu is a software engineer on the Security CAT (Code Analysis Technologies) team at Microsoft Security. She graduated from Duke University in 2020. At Microsoft, she helps teams across Microsoft adopt code security check to ensure comprehensive compliance with enterprise standards. Her daily work includes writing and maintaining static analysis tools to detect anti-patterns and security vulnerabilities in code, such as hardcoded credentials, weak cryptography, and dangling fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).

## <b>CI/CD jobs don't care about US budget cuts: why mirroring software vulnerability data matters</b>
### Terri, John 'Warthog9' Hawley  ([@terri](https://social.afront.org/@terri))  ([@warthog9](https://social.afront.org/@warthog9))
The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the biggest source of information about software vulnerabilities in the world. As more people have been using this data to help secure software supply chains, the servers behind the NVD have struggled to keep up. They implemented rate limiting and added an API to help people download less data at a time, but demand continued to grow, and continuous integration jobs didn't care about US budget cuts affecting those running the service. But those same test and scanning jobs have managed not to completely over-run the servers that handle software updates for popular Linux distributions. What if rather than convincing people to slurp data more carefully (while somehow also convincing them that vulnerability scanning was great and they should do it), we reached out to some open source mirroring experts and made some magic happen? This is the story of how we mirrored the world's vulnerability data and why.

John 'Warthog9' Hawley is a Linux kernel maintainer (ktest), FOSS mirror operator, wrangler of open source licensing, open hardware designer, and someone who believes in not only over engineering most things but that 12 gnomes in a trench coat sometimes works pretty darned well.
