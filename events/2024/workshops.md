## <b>So you'd like to present at a conference</b>
### Joe FitzPatrick (@securelyfitz)
So, you'd like to present at a conference?
Awesome - but making that decision is just the first step of a long journey. This workshop is primarily intended for people who already have ideas of things to present, but need some help fine-tuning them and understanding the process.
We'll start off in a lecture format covering all the parts of preparing, submitting and presenting your work, answering a lot of questions you might ask yourself.  We'll proceed into an extended question and answer session. Think of your questions ahead of time, and perhaps even ask them before the workshop. Finally, we'll use the remaining time to team up in groups to share our ideas and give each other feedback.
Hopefully you'll leave with a better idea of how to navigate the process, as well as a clearer idea of how to structure your submission and presentation.'

## <b>Capture The Flag (CTF) With Feedback</b>
### Jens Mache and Richard
Capture the flag (CTF) exercises can be great practice and fun. However, sometimes things get complicated. Even the best of us may sometimes be lost, move in the wrong direction or get frustrated. In this workshop, not only are we giving you an overview and access to several CTF exercises, you are also provided feedback and hints (in case you need some). This way, everybody who shows up and spends some time can successfully complete the CTF exercises. Short descriptions at https://edurange.org/scenarios.html

*Jens' certifications include SANS/ GIAC Certified Intrusion Analyst (GCIA), Penetration Tester (GPEN), Incident Handler (GCIH). Jens has been teaching security since 2007.*

## <b>Incident Response for Artificial Intelligence: Playtest New Tabletop Exercises with the AIRCTL Project for fun and stickers</b>
### Jonathan Reiter and Emily Soward 
Learn how to respond to security incidents involving Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the AIRCTL Project team. Join this hands-on workshop about preparing for common incident response (IR) scenarios using tabletop exercises. We will facilitate playtesting of a pre-release AI-themed expansion to Backdoors and Breaches, the tabletop game by Black Hills Information Security. In three sections of instructor-guided learning, participants will learn how to run a realistic tabletop IR exercise for an environment where your job is to protect cutting edge AI technology and R&D assets. NO artificial intelligence experience needed to play!

Participants will attend an introductory briefing by the AIRCTL team on AI for security professionals, four common types of AI incidents, and the mechanics of the Backdoors & Breaches tabletop IR game. 

Participants will then form teams, get guidance for your scenario, and breakout to roleplay as an Incident Responder or Incident Commander for a facilitated playtest of one of the common AI incident scenarios: R&D compromise, material breach via AI path, AI defacement & manipulation, AI exploitation.

Be prepared to commit at least one hour to the session to experience all segments. The intro briefing is 10 minutes with short Q&A. Each game scenario takes 30-60 minutes for play, depending on the IR team. Debrief discussion and exit survey will take roughly 20 minutes. An optional “all hands” debrief will follow. 

Participants who playtest any of the AIRCTL Project IR scenarios and share their experiences and ideas as feedback will be eligible for playtester credit on the AIRCTL pages — we want to see the community win and appreciate your time with us has value. We will be sharing a limited number of printed game materials, which attendees can take home. The session will not be recorded but notes and photos with consent are welcome.'

## <b>Roll Your Own EDR/XDR/MDR</b>
### Ken Westin (@kwestin and @cthulhu_answers)
In this two-hour hands-on workshop we will show attendees how to build their own EDR/XDR/MDR platform leveraging open-source tools. Attendees will learn to deploy  cross-platform EDR sensors, how to use sigma detection rules, write custom detection rules, and leverage open source adversary emulation tools ( Atomic Red Team) to test new them. We will then discuss how to extend these capabilities for investigations and threat hunting by integrating additional open source or free tools to gather additional telemetry such as Sysmon and Velociraptor.'

## <b>Intro to Generative AI security</b>
### Justin Wiley (https://linkedin.com/in/justinwiley)
Generative AI is everywhere and is seemingly being put into everything—it's amazing, it's terrifying, it's boring, it's *soooo* 2023.  But if you are building, buying or purchasing an AI product, how can you evaluate and mitigate the risks associated with generative AI?  In this workshop we'll learn about real-world attacks (prompt injection and jailbreaking), and then in the hands-on portion try to carry them out against a sample application.  We'll also talk about how to use what you learn to make smarter decisions when working with AI vendors.

You might be interested in this talk if you are:

- A security or privacy manager, a product manager, executive or developer with limited exposure to generative AI security
- You are building something with generative AI, buying something with gen AI, or hiring someone to build it for you
- Or are just generally interested in AI and security

If you already well versed in generative AI security, or are a professional security research you will likely be bored (but we would love feedback if you want to stick around!)

## <b>An Introduction to Generative Security Applications</b>
### Wu-chang Feng 
Generative AI and Large Language Models are changing the practice of cybersecurity as we know it, potentially automating many of the tasks that are currently being done by security practitioners.  This workshop provides an introduction to building applications using LangChain, a popular framework for constructing LLM applications.   After learning its basics, we will then walk through a variety of applications that utilize LLMs to perform security tasks and evaluate their results.'

Note: To run the Python notebooks, attendees will need a GMail account to run the notebook on Colab.
