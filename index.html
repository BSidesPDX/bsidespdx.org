    <p>We're postponing our 10th in-person event until 2022!</p>

    <p>The BSides Portland Board has decided not to hold an event in 2021 in the expectation that we’ll be back in full force with in-person events in 2022.</p>

    <h1> Why? </h1>

    <p> Spring is the time when BSides Portland volunteers start the process of preparing for the fall conference. Unfortunately, at this point in time there are too many unknowns for us to commit to holding an in-person event.
<br>
<br>
In 2020, we ran an online event. While it was a successful opportunity to continue our mission of cultivating the local information security community, it is difficult for us to differentiate our ‘local’ remote event from many others, and everyone is experiencing a bit of remote-event-fatigue at this point.
<br>
<br>
BSides Portland Organizers and volunteers are also a bit fatigued from the event. Because of this, the board decided the best bet would be to take a break in 2021 and ‘rebooting’ in 2022 </p>

    <h1> Will BSides Portland do anything in 2021? </h1>

    <p>Depending on safety, conditions, and motivation, we will consider running one or more informal social events in the fall. If so, we’ll annouce it via our email list and <a href="https://twitter.com/bsidespdx">Twitter</a></p>

    <h1>What’s coming in 2022?</h1>

    <p> <a href="http://hackboat.org/">HACKBOAT</a> should return in Spring of 2022. <a href="https://www.portlandspirit.com/">Portland Spirit</a> is allowing us to carry over our deposit until then. We’ll announce details by January 2022, and keep an eye out on the <a href="https://twitter.com/hackboatpdx">HACKBOAT Twitter</a>.
<br>
<br>
BSidesPDX should return as an in-person event in Fall 2022. We will announce dates and venue by May 2022 </p>
